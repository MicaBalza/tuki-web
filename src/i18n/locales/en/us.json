By creating Tuki Studio we wanted to go further: we formed a versatile team of illustrators, 2D and 3D animators, video editors, graphic designers, voice actors and sound engineers. This structure allows us to adapt to different styles, scale according to the needs of each project and offer visual content that really makes a difference. Our goal is to help pharmaceutical and healthcare brands connect with their audience through innovative and professional visual communication.",
